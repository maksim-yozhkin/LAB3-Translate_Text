Python is used for server-side web development, software development, mathematics, and system scripting, and is popular for Rapid
Application Development and as a scripting or glue language to tie existing components because of its high-level, built-in data structures,
dynamic typing, and dynamic binding. Program maintenance costs are reduced with Python due to the easily learned syntax and emphasis on readability.
Additionally, Python's support of modules and packages facilitates modular programs and reuse of code. Python is an open source community language,
so numerous independent programmers are continually building libraries and functionality for it.
